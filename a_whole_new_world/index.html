      I can show you the world<br>
Shining, shimmering, splendid<br>
Tell me, princess, now when did<br>
You last let your heart decide?<br>
<br>
I can open your eyes<br>
Take you wonder by wonder<br>
Over sideways and under<br>
On a magic carpet ride<br>
<br>
A whole new world<br>
A new fantastic point of view<br>
No one to tell us &quot;No&quot;<br>
Or where to go<br>
Or say we're only dreaming<br>
<br>
A whole new world<br>
A dazzling place I never knew<br>
But now from way up here<br>
It's crystal clear<br>
That now I'm in a whole new world with you<br>
<br>
Unbelievable sights<br>
Indescribable feeling<br>
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling<br>
Through an endless diamond sky<br>

      Don't you dare close your eyes<br>
      A hundred thousand things to see<br>
      Hold your breathâ€”it gets better<br>
      I'm like a shooting star<br>
      I've come so far<br>
      I can't go back to where I used to be<br>
      <br>
      A whole new world<br>
      With new horizons to pursue<br>
      I'll chase them anywhere<br>
      There's time to spare<br>
      Let me share this whole new world with you<br>
      <br>
      A whole new world<br>
      <br>
      (A whole new world)<br>
      A new fantastic point of view<br>
      No one to tell us &quot;No&quot;<br>
      Or where to go<br>
      Or say we're only dreaming<br>
      <br>
      A whole new world<br>
      Every turn a surprise<br>
      With new horizons to pursue<br>
      Every moment, red-letter<br>
      I'll chase them anywhere<br>
      There's time to spare<br>
      I'll chase them anywhere<br>
      There's time to spare<br>
      Let me share this whole new world with you<br>
      <br>
      A whole new world<br>
      A whole new world<br>
      That's where we'll be<br>
      That's where we'll be<br>
      A thrilling chase<br>
      A wondrous place<br>
      For you and me
